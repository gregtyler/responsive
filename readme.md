# Chrome Responsive extension #

* By Greg Tyler ([@gregtyler](http://twitter.com/gregtyler))

This adds some CSS and JavaScript to make websites like YouTube, Wikipedia, BBC iPlayer and Reddit more reponsive. It doesn't make them _completely_ responsive, just some key parts.

This whole extension is designed entirely around my usage of these sites. This is exactly why I haven't released it in any sort of formal capacity; it probably doesn't cater to your needs particularly well. But if you want to try it out, hack it around a bit yourself, then the code is all here for you to enjoy!
